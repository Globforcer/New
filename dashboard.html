                     If you are an EY client and you will use the Tool to access an EY report that was prepared pursuant to an engagement agreement between you and EY, your access to the Tool (and the contents thereof, including any such report) is subject to the terms and conditions of your engagement agreement with EY.
                     <br>
                     If you are not an EY client, or if you are an EY client with respect to matters unrelated to your current access to the Tool, your access to the Tool (and the contents thereof, including any EY reports) is subject to these Terms of Use and, where applicable, the terms and conditions of the release letter agreed between you and EY.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of use set out in these Terms of Use and in any release letter, the terms set out in the release letter shall prevail. EY is providing the Tool to our client and performing our services under the terms of our agreement with our client. The scope of our services to our client is clear and distinct from that of any other advisor to the client and EY will act independently from any other advisor to our client (and, for the avoidance of doubt, any other third parties that are not EY’s direct subcontractors).  EY will not be held liable for any work performed or services rendered by other advisors. You expressly acknowledge that any instruction to perform your services through the EY Tool comes directly from our client and that any interaction between you and EY should be treated as incidental.  You acknowledge and agree that the Tool and its contents are intended only for EY’s client, and that you will not forward, distribute, reproduce, copy or publish any information contained in the Tool to any other person without our prior written consent.
